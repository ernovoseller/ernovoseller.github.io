##(Formerly Ellen Feldman)

### PhD Candidate, California Institute of Technology

I am a PhD student in Control and Dynamical Systems, advised by Professors Yisong Yue and Joel W. Burdick. My research focuses on learning from human feedback, with applications to human-robot interaction and personalized medicine. My interests also include creating intelligent assistive devices, reinforcement learning, sequential decision-making, and applications of machine learning to healthcare. Outside of research, my other goals include positively impacting peopleâ€™s lives through teaching and outreach.
