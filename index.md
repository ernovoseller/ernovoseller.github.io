## About Me

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the US Army Research Lab, working with [Dr. Nicholas Waytowich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=leelUAgAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher and [CI Fellow](https://cifellows2020.org/) at UC Berkeley, working with Professor [Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) in the [AUTOLAB](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/). I completed my PhD in Control and Dynamical Systems at Caltech, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Yisong Yue](http://yisongyue.com/) and [Joel W. Burdick](http://eas.caltech.edu/people/jburdick). My research focuses on human-in-the-loop learning, sequential decision-making, and robot learning. Outside of research, my other goals include positively impacting people’s lives through teaching and outreach.

<!--robot learning and manipulation and includes work on reinforcement learning, human-in-the-loop learning, and simulation-to-reality transfer. My PhD work centered on human-in-the-loop learning with applications to robotic exoskeleton walking. More broadly, my interests include creating intelligent assistive devices, learning from human feedback, sequential decision-making, and applications of machine learning to robotics and healthcare. Outside of research, my other goals include positively impacting people’s lives through teaching and outreach.-->
